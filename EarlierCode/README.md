This folder contains the file "GL2GroupTheory.m" which contains group theory code from the earlier paper "Explicit open images for elliptic curves over Q" (https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.14959).

The rest of the files are from "https://github.com/AndrewVSutherland/Magma/" which consists of codes to deal with open subgroups of GL(2,Zhat) and SL(2,Zhat) (which are given as subgroups of GL(2,Z/N) and SL(2,Z/N), respectively).   This is significantly faster than using Magma's intrinsic functions.
